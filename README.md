## Learning Objectives

## Outline / Notes

*  This should be the follow up to the prior lab (2nd half of Blackjack). This should include the views and maybe have them make one or two more classes (if they didn't complete the game in the prior lab), the UI just make this game work. We don't have to dress it up to much, if you're in a great mood.. maybe we can supply them with animations.. but meh, that might be too much work. Just having them make a working game (even if the UI is ugly) is cool.
